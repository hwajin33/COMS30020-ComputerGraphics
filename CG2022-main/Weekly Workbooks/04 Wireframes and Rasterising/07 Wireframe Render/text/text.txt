Now that you know how to project individual vertices from a 3D model on the image plane, the next step is to produce a "wireframe" render of the Cornell Box model. The basic principle is to create a 2D `CanvasTriangle` for each 3D `ModelTriangle` found in the model. You can then reuse your 2D stroked triangle drawing function that you wrote for the previous workbook to create the wireframe render. You see - the time spent working in 2D was useful after all ! If everything works correctly, you should end up with a wireframe render that looks something like the image below.
