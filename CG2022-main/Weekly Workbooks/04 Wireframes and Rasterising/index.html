<p>This is the workbook we’ve all be waiting for - we finally start to work in 3 dimensions !</p>
<p>Our fundamental objective for this workbook (in fact the rest of the unit !) is to take a 3D model (specified as a bunch of vertex positions in 3 dimensional space) and attempt to render them as a 2 dimensional image. Although it might seem like there are a lot of complex tasks in this workbook, many of them make good use of the 2D drawing functions that you have written previously. For this reason, such tasks can be quickly achieved by just calling existing functions in your code.</p>
<p>Rendering a 3D model onto a 2D canvas requires us to take a particular perspective/viewpoint on that 3D model. This is only to be expected - a scene will look different depending on where you view it from. To aid in our discussion, we introduce the concept of a <em>camera</em>. Take a look at the slides and audio narration linked to above for a discussion of this concept. You should also be sure to view the video briefing for this workbook (link at the top of this document) since it contains important background information about this week’s tasks.</p>
<p>To help you in completing this workbook, you have been provided with a <code>ModelTriangle</code> class (found in the <code>libs/sdw</code> folder). This class represents a triangular plane in 3D space and contains attributes that hold the positions of its three vertices, as well as the colour of the triangle’s surface. As usual, this class overrides the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator so that you can direct it to <code>cout</code> for debugging purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
<strong>Important</strong>: Make sure you read the “Hints and Tips” at the end of each section before attempting that task. This might save you a lot of time and anguish !</p>

<h3 id="task-2-geometry-files">Task 2: Geometry Files</h3>
<p><a href='02%20Geometry%20Files/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a> <a href='02%20Geometry%20Files/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a></p>
<p>The first implementation task in this practical is to write a low-level file reader that can parse in 3D models from flat data files. Although the focus of this unit is NOT on grammars and parsing, understanding how models can be stored in data files provides us with valuable insight into the essential characteristics of 3D geometry and material properties. View the slides and audio narration above to find out about the OBJ file format.</p>
<p>Once you are happy with the concepts above, write a function that reads in <a href="models/cornell-box.obj" target="_blank">this sample OBJ geometry file</a> and use the data it contains to populate a vector of <code>ModelTriangles</code>. At this stage, you should only focus on reading in vertices (lines that being with a <code>v</code>) and faces/facets (lines that being with an <code>f</code>). We will deal with the other types of line later on in this workbook. Be careful - remember that vertices in OBJ files are indexed from 1 (whereas vectors are indexed from 0).</p>
<p>Once the sample geometry file has been loaded, loop through all of the triangles in the vector and print them out, (you should be able to direct <code>ModelTriangles</code> to <code>cout</code> !) Open the OBJ file with a text editor and manually check your printout agains a couple of triangles - just to make sure the data has been successfully loaded.</p>
<p>Add a scaling factor (float) parameter to your OBJ loading function that scales the position of all vertices at the point at which they are read in from the file. This is done in order to adjust the size of the model when it is loaded (different models might be created to different scales !). This is to avoid the “bunnyzilla” problem illustrated in the image below - here two models have been loaded in from separate files, but the model of the rabbit was originally created with an unusually large size. Using your scaling factor it would be possible to adjust the different models to a consistent size.</p>
<p><img src="02%20Geometry%20Files/images/giant-bunny.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
To read in the data from the geometry file, you might like to make use of an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_files.asp" target="_blank">ifstream</a> and make calls to the <code>getline</code> function. A <code>split</code> function has also been provided (see the <code>Utils</code> class in the <code>libs/sdw</code> folder) to make tokenising of lines easier. But it is really up to you how you choose to parse in the files.</p>
<p>Just to reiterate - this unit is about graphical rendering, not grammars and parsing. As such you should keep your OBJ parser as simple as possible. It is important to remember that we will NOT be testing the robustness of your parser by throwing it challenging or malformed geometry files. Only implement the aspects of the OBJ file format that you need to complete the tasks at hand. Your parser only needs to be “good enough” to load in the sample OBJ geometry file provided above (and any other models that YOU choose to use).</p>
<p>When loading in the Cornell Box model, we suggest you use a scaling factor of 0.35 since this will bring the all dimensions of the vertices within the range of -1.0 to 1.0 (which seems sensible and logical).</p>

<h3 id="task-3-material-files">Task 3: Material Files</h3>
<p><a href='03%20Material%20Files/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a> <a href='03%20Material%20Files/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a></p>
<p>Clearly positional information is important, but how do we know what the model surfaces should actually <em>look</em> like ? When working with OBJ files, this kind of aesthetic information is stored in a separate “materials” file. Your next job is therefore to write a function to read in <a href="models/cornell-box.mtl" target="_blank">this sample OBJ material file</a> and populate a “palette” of colours. You can use the previously encountered <code>Colour</code> class for this purpose (this is where the <code>name</code> attribute now becomes useful).</p>
<p>Once you have successfully loaded in the materials file, add some additional code to your geometry parsing function (from the previous task) so that it accesses your colour palette when it encounters a reference to a material (lines that begin with <code>usemtl</code> in the OBJ geometry file). It makes sense to read in the materials file <em>before</em> you read in the geometry file - this is so you already have the colours stored in a data structure when you encounter references to them in the geometry file. Note that <code>ModelTriangle</code> objects have a <code>colour</code> attribute that can be used to store a reference to the colour of triangles.</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
You could just use a vector to store the palette of colours or, if you want something a bit fancier, use a hashmap or hashtable for more efficient colour lookup (using the name of the colour as a key).</p>

<h3 id="task-4-projection-in-theory">Task 4: Projection in Theory</h3>
<p><a href='04%20Projection%20in%20Theory/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a> <a href='04%20Projection%20in%20Theory/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a> <a href='04%20Projection%20in%20Theory/animation/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/animation.png" /> </a></p>
<p>Now that we have geometry and material data loaded, we can attempt to render a graphical representation of the sample model onto the SDL canvas - or as it is often called in 3D rendering: the “image plane”. This process is a little complicated, so we have split the job into two tasks - the “understanding” (this section) and the “doing” (the next section). Make sure you understand the theory first, before trying to implement the concepts. First watch just the animated video linked to above (the last of the blue buttons) for a high-level description of this process.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, calculating the projected position of a vertex on the image plane will involve the <em>(x,y,z)</em> position of the vertex in 3D space. The distance between the camera and image plane will also have an effect on the position that the vertex will appear on that image plane. Everything is based around the notion of similar triangles - take a look at the slides and narrated audio for a lower-level explanation of how this works. Note that we illustrate the process in two dimensions (because it is a lot easier to show on a powerpoint slide), however the concept “scales” to three dimensions (we just need to do the same thing in x as we did in y).</p>
<p>When rendering our sample model, there is the additional complexity that the origin of the Cornell Box model is in the centre of the “room”, whereas the origin of the image plane is in the top left hand corner (due to the way the SDL coordinate systems works). When rendering a scene onto the image plane, what we really want is for the centre of the room to appear in the <em>centre</em> of the image plane. To achieve this, we need to shift the calculated position of each vertex <em>before</em> we draw it onto the SDL window. If we shift everything to the <em>right</em> by half the width of the image plane and <em>down</em> by half the height of the image plane, the render will appear in the middle of the SDL window (as shown in the right-hand image below). If we didn’t do this, the centre of the room would appear in the top left corner of the drawing window (as shown in the left-hand image below).</p>
<p><img src="04%20Projection%20in%20Theory/images/aligned.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="section-3"></h1>
<h3 id="task-5-projection-in-practice">Task 5: Projection in Practice</h3>
<p>In the previous task, we considered projection onto the image plane abstractly and in theory. In this task we explore how this projection is actually achieved and then go on to implement it in code. You should start by adding a new function to your project called <code>getCanvasIntersectionPoint</code> which takes in the following three parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cameraPosition</code>: the location of the camera in 3 dimensional space (passed in as a <code>vec3</code>)</li>
<li><code>vertexPosition</code>: the 3 dimensional position of a single vertex (passed in as a <code>vec3</code>)</li>
<li><code>focalLength</code>: the distance from camera to the image plane/canvas</li>
</ul>
<p>Add code to this new method to calculate and return the 2D <code>CanvasPoint</code> position at which the model vertex is projected onto the image plane. For a particular vertex <em>i</em> that has a position in 3D space of <em>(x<sup>i</sup>, y<sup>i</sup>, z<sup>i</sup>)</em> we can calculate its position on the image plane <em>(u<sup>i</sup>, v<sup>i</sup>)</em> using the two formulae provided below (where <em>f</em> is focal length, <em>W</em> and <em>H</em> are the width and height of the image plane). For reference, the <code>W/2</code> and <code>H/2</code> elements are the shift in origin used to align the centre of the room with the centre of the image plane (as shown in the diagram from the previous task).</p>
<p><img src="05%20Projection%20in%20Practice/images/transpose-to-canvas.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
Note that these formulae assume the model vertices are in the <em>camera coordinate system</em> (i.e. the camera is the origin and x, y and z are distances relative to the camera position). The vertices in the OBJ model are however all in the <em>model coordinate system</em> (i.e. relative to the centre of the room). As a result of this, you will need to do a transposition in order to convert positions from one coordinate system to the other. You will need to get used to such transpositions in this unit, there are numerous origins we have to cope with !</p>
<p>In the interests of consistency, you should adopt the convention that positive z is “out of the screen” (towards you) and negative z is “into the screen” (away from you). Things can get really tricky if different students use different z directions !</p>
<p>A question that is often asked is “where should I position my camera ?”. A good starting point is to place your camera centred in the x and y dimensions, but “stepped back” a bit in the z (by 4.0). Your initial camera position should therefore be <code>(0.0, 0.0, 4.0)</code> - you should store this position in a <code>vec3</code> variable (since this will make calculations a lot easier later on).</p>
<p>As for the focal length, a good distance to use is <code>2.0</code>. Assuming that you followed the above advice about camera position, this value will position the image plane halfway between the camera and the model. Strange things will happen if you position the image plane behind the model, or even behind the camera !</p>
<p>It is important to note that focal length is a “pure” distance (i.e. it does not have a direction). You can think of the image plane as being “attached” to the camera. No matter where the camera is or what direction it is pointing, the image plane will remain centred in the camera field of view, always at the same distance from it (the focal length).</p>
<h1 id="section-4"></h1>
<h3 id="task-6-pointcloud-render">Task 6: Pointcloud Render</h3>
<p>Now that we have a function that can map/project a 3D vertex onto a 2D canvas point, it becomes possible to actually display a render of a 3D model !</p>
<p>We start with the simplest render possible - a “pointcloud”.</p>
<p>Using your <code>getCanvasIntersectionPoint</code> function, calculate the image plane positions of each vertex of the previously loaded Cornell Box. Due to the size of the model (vertex positions in the range -1.0 to 1.0) the positions of the calculated points on the image plane will all be very close to the centre of the screen. To solve this problem, you should apply an “image plane scaling” to resize the coordinates so that they fit nicely onto the drawing window. A mulitplier of 240 (i.e. the height of the drawing window) is a good value to try for this scaling factor. Make sure you scale x and y by the same amount (in order to maintain the aspect ratio of the point cloud).</p>
<p>If you draw a single white pixel at each projected image plane position, you should end up with a pointcloud render that looks like the image shown below. Although very minimalistic, with a bit of imagination you can see the room corners and boxes from the sample model.</p>
<p><img src="06%20Pointcloud%20Render/images/pointcloud.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
You might find (depending on how you write your code) that your render is flipped upside-down. Any ideas why this might be ? Any thoughts about how to fix this problem ?</p>
<h1 id="section-5"></h1>
<h3 id="task-7-wireframe-render">Task 7: Wireframe Render</h3>
<p>Now that you know how to project individual vertices from a 3D model on the image plane, the next step is to produce a “wireframe” render of the Cornell Box model. The basic principle is to create a 2D <code>CanvasTriangle</code> for each 3D <code>ModelTriangle</code> found in the model. You can then reuse your 2D stroked triangle drawing function that you wrote for the previous workbook to create the wireframe render. You see - the time spent working in 2D was useful after all ! If everything works correctly, you should end up with a wireframe render that looks something like the image below.</p>
<p><img src="07%20Wireframe%20Render/images/wireframe.png" /></p>
<h1 id="section-6"></h1>
<h3 id="task-8-rasterised-render">Task 8: Rasterised Render</h3>
<p>After you have successfully rendered a wireframe of the model, the next step is to fill those triangles ! This is going to be a lot easier than you might think !!! The image pane is 2D and you have already written a 2D “filled triangle” rasterising function in a previous workbook. Using the correct colours to fill the triangles, call this function in order to draw the Cornell Box model. The end product should look something like the image below (take a look at this week’s briefing video if your render looks similar, but slightly different).</p>
<p><img src="08%20Rasterised%20Render/images/overlap.png" /></p>
<h1 id="section-7"></h1>
<h3 id="task-9-occlusion-problem">Task 9: Occlusion Problem</h3>
<p><a href='09%20Occlusion%20Problem/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a> <a href='09%20Occlusion%20Problem/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a> <a href='09%20Occlusion%20Problem/animation/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/animation.png" /> </a></p>
<p>You might have noticed a problem with the above image ? Depending on the order in which the triangles appear in an OBJ file (and the order you store them in your code), rendered triangles can sometimes overlap each other inappropriately. For example, in the image shown in the previous task, the blue box is shown overlapping the red one - which is not the case in the true model. View the slides and narrated audio above to understand what causes this problem and what we can do to solve it.</p>
<p>In your code, create a 2D array of floats (the dimensions of the array being the same width and height as the image plane / drawing window). You are going to use this array to keep track of the z depth of the model element drawn for each pixel on the screen. The data stored in this “depth buffer” will allow us to decide what colour to paint a pixel when there is contention. It is important that we store the <em><strong>inverse</strong></em> of the z depth of the model element represented. We will explore the reason for this in a future workbook - for the time being you will have to take this on trust (or you could take a look at <a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation/visibility-problem-depth-buffer-depth-interpolation" target="_blank">this chapter</a> from scratch-a-pixel if you <em>really</em> can’t wait).</p>
<p>When filling the depth buffer, you need to calculate the z depth of specific points on the surface of a triangle. It is worth observing that you do not actually <em>have</em> depth information for all these points. These depths can however be calculated by interpolating from the depth of known points (i.e. the vertices). Watch the animation linked to at the top of this section for help on achieving this.</p>
<p>Use your depth buffer in your drawing functions to help decide what colour to set a particular image plane pixel. In some cases the first colour you draw a pixel will be the correct one, in other cases this colour will need to be overwritten by a subsequent colour. If your depth buffer is operating correctly, you should see something like the image shown below. Don’t forget to read the “Hints &amp; Tips” section below before attempting this !</p>
<p><img src="09%20Occlusion%20Problem/images/overlap-fixed.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
Note that the <code>CanvasPoint</code> class has a <code>depth</code> attribute that you might like to use to help you keep track of the z depth of each vertex of a <code>CanvasTriangle</code>.</p>
<p>When you create the depth buffer array you should first initialise every element to zero. This signifies that at the start (before rendering the scene takes place) that there is no model element represented in any pixel position. Another way to think of this is that this value represents <code>1/Z</code> where Z is infinity, so that any model element that is subsequently encountered is <em>bound</em> to be closer.</p>
<p>Because we are using the inverse of the z depth, we must remember that the colour a particular pixel should be drawn must be the model element with the <em>largest</em> <code>1/Z</code>. Consider the diagram below for example - the pixel on the image plane through which the dotted line passes should clearly be drawn red (since the red triangle is the closest to the camera/eye). However <code>1/Z</code> for the red triangle (0.5) is <em>greater</em> than that of the blue triangle (0.25). The <em>largest</em> <code>1/Z</code> always wins !</p>
