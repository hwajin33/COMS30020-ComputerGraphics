We start this week by writing one of the core building blocks of any graphics framework - a function to draw straight lines. Although this might seem simple and almost trivial, there are some technical implementation issues that prove an interesting challenge !

View the slides and audio narration linked to above and then, using the knowledge you have gained, add a function to your code to draw a simple line in the SDL window. Your function should accept as parameters a `from` point and a `to` point. A `CanvasPoint` class has been provided in the `libs/sdw` folder to help you. This class represents a particular point on the drawing window (what is often called the drawing "canvas"). This class contains the x and y coordinates of the point, as well as a number of other attributes that we will use in subsequent workbooks. You can ignore these additional attributes for the time being - we will make use of them in later workbooks. Add `#include <CanvasPoint.h>` to the includes section of your code in order to import this class.

You should also allow a colour to be passed into your function so that lines of different colours can be drawn. A `Colour` class has been provided in the `libs/sdw` folder to help you - this class contains values for red, green and blue channels as well as an optional name for the colour (don't worry about naming your colours for this workbook - we will use colour names in a later exercise). Add `#include <Colour.h>` to your code in order to import this class.

Test your code by drawing some lines to and from some easily verifiable positions (i.e. lines we can easily see have been drawn correctly). For example, you might like to try the following:
- A line from the top-left corner of the window to the centre of the window
- A vertical line all the way down the middle of the screen
- A horizontal line a third the width of the screen, centred both horizontally and vertically
