This workbook continues from where we left off last week - implementing additional features for the rasterising renderer. We start by (optionally) adding texture mapping to the existing flat-colour renderer. Following on from that, we make the renderer interactive, so that the user can navigate the camera around the model. Note that if you didn't complete all of the tasks from last week, you should finish these first before starting on this week's workbook.
